# L'économie de la colère - Jeu de l'ultimatum
Site crée dans le cadre du TER de L3 MIASHS, qui porte sur l'experience économique du jeu de l'ultimatum.

Your emotions may affect your economic behaviour more than you think. Previous studies have indeed revealed that consumption and implicit or explicit bargaining are affected by sentiments. In this study, we focus particularly on anger. In the context of the “yellow vest” movement, it is imperative to understand how anger and economic behaviour are related.

To this end, we first reviewed the literature. Then we created an experiment, by replicating “the ultimatum game” as a web application. This game deals with implicit bargaining between two people, and “take it or leave it” decisions. Our goal was to prove that most of the players exhibed rational behaviour. For this purpose, we established and tested two hypotheses on the behaviour of the participants, along the lines of the theory of rationality. This game has been played by 68 participants, mainly final year of MIASHS* degree students.

The results refuted both of our hypotheses. Participants’ behaviour has been shown to be less rational than expected, but the results were still interesting as they revealed new elements, extending the understanding of the game. The limitations of the web browser based context contributed to some extent to the unexpected results.
