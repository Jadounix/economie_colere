  <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
  <p>Your emotions may affect your economic behaviour more than you think. <br> Previous studies have indeed revealed that consumption, implicit or explicit bargaining are leaded by your affects. In this study, we are focusing especially on anger. In this period of yellow vest movement, it is imperative to understand how anger and economic behaviour are related.
To this end, we made up an experiment based on the ultimatum game, to analyse how anger influences  “take it or leave it” decisions.
